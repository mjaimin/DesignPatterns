CommonClosurePrinciple

# Common Closure Principle #

"Classes within a released component should share common closure. If one need to be changed, they all are likely to need to be changed. What affects one, affect all."

-	A change must not cause modification to all released components
-	Change must affect smallest possible number of released components
-	Classes within a component must be cohesive Given a particular kind of change, either all
-	classes in a component must be modified or no class needs to be modified
-	Reduces frequency of re-release of component
