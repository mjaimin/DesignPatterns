02. Abstraction And Inheritance

# Abstraction #

Abstraction provides a way to manage complexity by emphasizing essential characteristics and suppressing implementation details.

**Allows postponement of certain design decisions that occur at various levels of analysis, e.g.,**

- Representational/Algorithmic considerations
- Architectural/Structural considerations
- External/Functional considerations

**Basic abstraction mechanisms**

- Procedural abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of an action from the details of how the action is implemented.
- Data abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of data from the details of how the data are represented.

# Inheritance # (Is-a Relationship)

A programming technique in which a derived class extends the functionality of a base class, inheriting all of its state and behavior.

-	A hierarchical connection between two class where one type can be treated as a specialized version of the other

-	Therefore, we may be able to modify and/or reuse sections of the inheritance hierarchy without disturbing existing code, e.g.,
	-	Change sibling subtree interfaces i.e., a consequence of inheritance
	-	Change implementation of ancestors i.e., a consequence of data abstraction

**Superclass**: the parent class in an inheritance relationship

**Subclass**: the child class in an inheritance relationship

+	Can have new state and add new behavior
	
**Subclass extends the superclass**

Maltose - also known as malt sugar

Hops - hop plant Humulus lupulus. They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer


# Inheritance Vs.Delegation #

+	Favor composition over inheritance
+	Inheritance should not be used for code reuse or to take advantage of polymorphism
+	It is harder to maintain inheritance based code than composition based code.
+	Use inheritance
	+	when the complete interface of the superclass applies to the subclass candidate
	+	there is a permanent is-a relationship
	+	superclass is stable.
	+	For specialization
+	Composition can be used
	+	some features of core class are irrelevant, ie,new class is not a true functional subtype
	+	to provide implementation to some specific functionality.
	+	high proportion of code of base class need to be rewritten
	+	Use composition to extend functionality by delegating to more appropriate objects.
+	Interfaces can be used
	+	to maintain separation of between specification and implementation
	+	to provide reuse and polymorphism across hierarchies
