# Abstraction #

Abstraction provides a way to manage complexity by emphasizing essential characteristics and suppressing implementation details.

**Allows postponement of certain design decisions that occur at various levels of analysis, e.g.,**

- Representational/Algorithmic considerations
- Architectural/Structural considerations
- External/Functional considerations

**Basic abstraction mechanisms**

- Procedural abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of an action from the details of how the action is implemented.
- Data abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of data from the details of how the data are represented.

# Inheritance #

-	Inheritance allows you to write code to handle certain cases and allows other developers to write code that handles more specialized cases, while your code continues to work
-	Inheritance partitions a system architecture into semi-disjoint components that are related hierarchically

-	Therefore, we may be able to modify and/or reuse sections of the inheritance hierarchy without disturbing existing code, e.g.,
	-	Change sibling subtree interfaces i.e., a consequence of inheritance
	-	Change implementation of ancestors i.e., a consequence of data abstraction
