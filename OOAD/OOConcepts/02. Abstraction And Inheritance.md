# Abstraction #

Abstraction provides a way to manage complexity by emphasizing essential characteristics and suppressing implementation details.

**Allows postponement of certain design decisions that occur at various levels of analysis, e.g.,**

- Representational/Algorithmic considerations
- Architectural/Structural considerations
- External/Functional considerations

**Basic abstraction mechanisms**

- Procedural abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of an action from the details of how the action is implemented.
- Data abstraction 
	* The separation of the logical properties of data from the details of how the data are represented.

# Inheritance # (Is-a Relationship)

A programming technique in which a derived class extends the functionality of a base class, inheriting all of its state and behavior.

-	A hierarchical connection between two class where one type can be treated as a specialized version of the other

-	Therefore, we may be able to modify and/or reuse sections of the inheritance hierarchy without disturbing existing code, e.g.,
	-	Change sibling subtree interfaces i.e., a consequence of inheritance
	-	Change implementation of ancestors i.e., a consequence of data abstraction

**Superclass**: the parent class in an inheritance relationship

**Subclass**: the child class in an inheritance relationship

+	Can have new state and add new behavior
	
**Subclass extends the superclass**
