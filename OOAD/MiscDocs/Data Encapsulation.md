##Data encapsulation##

**Data encapsulation** is a mechanism of bundling the data and the functions in program.
When we fully encapsulate code, we actually build an impenetrable wall to protect the contained code from accidental corruption due to the silly little errors that we are all prone to make.
We also tend to isolate errors to small sections of code to make them easier to find and fix.
