## DATA Abstraction ##

**Data Abstraction** is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.

An abstract specification of and Object tells us the behaviour of an object independent of its implementation. i.e. It tells us, what an object does independent of how it works. 

In programming languages, a data abstraction becomes an **abstract data type** (ADT) or a user-defined type, which is implemented as a Class


**Examples:**

*Queues or Stack*
- Implementation with Array
- Implementation with a Linked List.
