# The Dependency Inversion Principle #

## Principle ##

A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

## Discussion ##

+ In an application we have low level classes which implement basic and primary operations and high level classes which encapsulate complex logic and rely on the low level classes.
+ A natural way of implementing such structures would be to write low level classes and once we have them to write the complex high level classes.
+ But this is not a flexible design. What happens if we need to replace a low level class?
+ Let's take the classical example of a copy module which read characters from keyboard and write them to the printer device.
+ The high level class containing the logic is the **Copy** class. The low level classes are **KeyboardReader** and **PrinterWriter**.
+ In a bad design the high level class uses directly the low level classes. In this case if we want to change the design to direct the output to a new FileWriter class we have to change the Copy class.
+ Since the high level modules contains the complex logic they should not depend on the low level modules
+ a new abstraction layer should be created to decouple the two levels

+ According to the Dependency Inversion Principle, the way of designing a class structure is to start from high level modules to the low level modules:
+ High Level Classes -> Abstraction Layer -> Low Level Classes
  1. Write interfaces to low level modules (abstract layer)
  2. Make sure the high level classes use only references to the abstract interfaces
  3. Use some creational pattern to make the connection (i.e. insert the reference to the right low level class into the high level class)

```CPP
/*The Bad Copy*/
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
class KeyboardReader
{
    public:
        std::string Read()
        {
            return std::string("SomeString");
        }
};

class PrinterWritter
{
    public:
        void Write(std::string output)
        {
            std::cout<<output<<std::endl;
        }
};

class Copy
{
    private:
        KeyboardReader* reader;
        PrinterWritter* writter;

    public:
        void DoWork()
        {
            this->reader = new KeyboardReader();
            this->writter = new PrinterWritter();
            this->writter->Write(this->reader->Read());
        }
};

int main()
{

    Copy* badCopy = new Copy();
    badCopy->DoWork();
}
```

And the Good Code~~~

```CPP
/* The Good Copy */
#include<string>
#include<iostream>

class IReader
{
    public:
        virtual std::string Read()=0;
};

class KeyboardReader : public IReader
{
    public:
        std::string Read()
        {
            return std::string("SomeString");
        }
};

class IWriter
{
    public:
        virtual void Write(std::string output)=0;
};

class PrinterWriter : public IWriter
{
    public:
        void Write(std::string output)
        {
            std::cout<<output<<std::endl;
        }
};

class FileWriter : public IWriter
{
    public:
        void Write(std::string output)
        {
            std::cout<<output<<std::endl;
        }
};


class Copy
{
    private:
        IReader* reader;
        IWriter* writer;

    public:
        Copy(IReader* reader, IWriter* writer)
        {
            this->reader = reader;
            this->writer = writer;
        }

        void DoWork()
        {
            this->writer->Write(this->reader->Read());
        }
};

int main()
{
    // Send output to Printer
    IReader* r = new KeyboardReader();
    IWriter* pw = new PrinterWriter();
    Copy* cp = new Copy(r, pw);
    cp->DoWork();

    // Send output to FileStream now
    IWriter* fw = new FileWriter();
    Copy* cpf = new Copy(r, fw);
    cpf->DoWork();
}
```
