# Good Modules (think “pluggability”) #
+	Low coupling
+	High Cohesion
+	Encapsulate (interface)
+	Remember
	+	**Definition: Cohesion** – How closely the operations in a routine are related.( How closely related are the internal workings of a module. )
	+	**Definition: Coupling** – The strength of the connection between two routines.( The number of connections between modules. )
