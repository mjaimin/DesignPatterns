##Way to remember design patterns

##Creational Patterns

  + **Abstract Factory:** Creates an instance of several families of classes

  + **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation

  + **Factory Method:** Creates an instance of several derived classes

  + **Prototype:** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

  + **Singleton:** A class in which only a single instance can exist

##Structural Patterns

  + **Adapter:** Match interfaces of different classes

  + **Bridge:** Separates an objects abstraction from its implementation

  + **Composite:** Allows a group of objects representing hierarchies to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. 

  + **Decorator:** Can dynamically surround a class and allows new behavior to be added to an existing object on the fly.

  + **Facade:** A single class that represents an entire subsystem

  + **Flyweight:** A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

  + **Proxy:** An object representing another object


##Behavioral Patterns

  + **Mediator:** Defines simplified communication between classes

  + **Memento:** Capture and restore an object's internal state

  + **Interpreter:** A way to include language elements in a program

  + **Iterator:** Sequentially access the elements of a collection

  + **Chain of Resp:** Allows commands to be chained together dynamically to handle a request.

  + **Command:** Encapsulate a command request as an object

  + **State:** Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

  + **Strategy:** Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

  + **Observer:** A way of notifying change to a number of classes

  + **Template Method:** Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a 
subclass

  + **Visitor:** Defines a new operation to a class without change
