## GOF Design Patterns

+ **Creational Patterns:** These design patterns provide ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic, instead of instantiating objects directly using the new operator. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

+ **Structural Patterns:** These design patterns deal with class and object composition. The concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

+ **Behavioral Patterns:** These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
