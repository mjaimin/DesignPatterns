## Creational Patterns
- These patterns support one of the most common tasks in object-oriented programming is the creation of objects in a system. 
- Most Object Oriented systems of any complexity require many objects to be instantiated over time
- These patterns support the creation process by helping to provide the following capabilities: 
    +   **Generic instantiation** – This allows objects to be created in a system without having to identify a specific class type in code.
    +   **Simplicity** – Some of the patterns make object creation easier, so callers will not have to write large, complex code to instantiate an object. 
    +   **Creation constraints** – Some patterns enforce constraints on the type or number of objects that can be created within a system.

The following are the properties of Creational patterns:
1. They work on the basis of how objects can be created
2. They isolate the details of object creation
3. Code is independent of the type of object to be created

  + **Abstract Factory:** Factory for building related objects
  + **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation
  + **Factory Method:** Creates an instance of several derived classes
  + **Prototype:** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
  + **Singleton:** A class in which only a single instance can exist
