##Creational Patterns

The following are the properties of Creational patterns:
1. They work on the basis of how objects can be created
2. They isolate the details of object creation
3. Code is independent of the type of object to be created

  + **Abstract Factory:** Factory for building related objects

  + **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation

  + **Factory Method:** Creates an instance of several derived classes

  + **Prototype:** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

  + **Singleton:** A class in which only a single instance can exist
