##Creational Patterns

  + **Abstract Factory:** Factory for building related objects

  + **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation

  + **Factory Method:** Creates an instance of several derived classes

  + **Prototype:** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

  + **Singleton:** A class in which only a single instance can exist
