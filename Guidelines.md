+	Use Decorators to avoid hierarchy explosion.
+	Use Proxies to serve as sophisticated references.
+	Use Iterators to provide sequential access to the elements of a collection.
+	Use Chain of Responsibility to delegate along a linked list of objects.
+	Use Strategies to pass algorithms to objects.
+	Use Commands to pass requests to objects.
+	Use Observer for asynchronous notification.
+	Use the Composite Pattern to treat objects and collections of objects uniformly.
+	Use Factories to delegate the production of objects.
