##Structural Patterns

  + **Adapter:** Match interfaces of different classes

  + **Bridge:** Separates an objects abstraction from its implementation

  + **Composite:** Allows a group of objects representing hierarchies to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. 

  + **Decorator:** Can dynamically surround a class and allows new behavior to be added to an existing object on the fly.

  + **Facade:** A single class that represents an entire subsystem

  + **Flyweight:** Provides a way to share data among many small classes in an efficient manner. 

  + **Proxy:** An object representing another object or Provides a placeholder to a more complex class that is costly to instantiate.
