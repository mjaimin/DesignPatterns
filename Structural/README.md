## Structural Patterns ##

**The following are the properties of Structural patterns:**

+ They design the structure of objects and classes so that they can compose to achieve larger results
+ The focus is on simplifying the structure and identifying the relationship between classes and objects
+ They focus on class inheritance and composition

  + **Adapter:** Match interfaces of different classes

  + **Bridge:** Separates an objects abstraction from its implementation

  + **Composite:** Allows a group of objects representing hierarchies to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object.

  + **Decorator:** Provides an enhanced interface

  + **Facade:** A single class that represents an entire subsystem

  + **Flyweight:** Provides a way to share data among many small classes in an efficient manner.

  + **Proxy:** An object representing another object or Provides a placeholder to a more complex class that is costly to instantiate.
