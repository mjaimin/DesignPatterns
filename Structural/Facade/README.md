The Facade pattern provides a simple interface and controls access to a series of complicated interfaces and subsystems.

The role of the service layer is to act as an entry point into the application; sometimes this is known as a facade.

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

Simplify the interface to a complex subsystem (
Reorganize a system with many subsystems into identifiable layers with single entry points (
