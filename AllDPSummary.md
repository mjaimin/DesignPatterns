## Creational Design Patterns #

### Singleton ###

A class for which only a one single instance can exist in the system

### Factory Method ###

Creates an object without hardcoding its type in the code

### Abstract Factory ###

Creates groups of related objects without specifying the exact concrete classes

### Object Pool ###

Allows to recycle objects that are no longer in use

### Prototype ###

Allows to instantiate a class by copying or cloning the properties of an existing object

## Behavioral Design Patterns #

### Observer ###

A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### Chain of responsibility ###

A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### Command ###

Encapsulate a command request as an object

### Interpreter ###

A way to include language elements in a program

### Iterator ###

Sequentially access the elements of a collection

### Mediator ###

Defines simplified communication between classes

### Memento ###

Capture and restore an object's internal state

### State ###

Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

### Strategy ###

Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

### Template method ###

Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

### Visitor ###

Defines a new operation to a class


## Structural Design Patterns ##

### Adapter ###

For gluing together incompatible classes

### Proxy ###

An object representing another object

### Bridge ###

Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

### Decorator ###

Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### Façade ###

A single class that represents an entire subsystem/library
