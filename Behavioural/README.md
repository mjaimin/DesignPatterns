##Behavioural Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on the responsibilities that an object has. It deals with the interaction among objects to achieve larger functionality.

  + **Mediator:**  Uses a class to simplify communication between other classes  

  + **Memento:** Capture and restore an object's internal state

  + **Interpreter:** Defines a way to include language elements in a program

  + **Iterator:** Formalizes the way we move through a list of data  

  + **Chain of Responsibility:**  Allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request  

  + **Command:** Encapsulate a command request as an object

  + **State:** Alter an object's behaviour when its state changes

  + **Strategy:** Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

  + **Observer:**  Defines the way a number of classes can be notified of a change

  + **Template Method:**  Provides an abstract definition of an algorithm  

  + **Visitor:** Defines a new operation to a class without change
