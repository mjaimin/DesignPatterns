##Behavioural Patterns

  + **Mediator:** Defines simplified communication between classes

  + **Memento:** Capture and restore an object's internal state

  + **Interpreter:** A way to include language elements in a program

  + **Iterator:** Sequentially access the elements of a collection

  + **Chain of Responsibility:** Allows commands to be chained together dynamically to handle a request.

  + **Command:** Encapsulate a command request as an object

  + **State:** Alter an object's behaviour when its state changes

  + **Strategy:** Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

  + **Observer:** A way of notifying change to a number of classes

  + **Template Method:** Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a 
subclass

  + **Visitor:** Defines a new operation to a class without change
